Hello, Interns! 👋

Welcome to your Git Challenge! 🚀
This is no ordinary repository. 🕵️‍♂️ Hidden within these commits is a secret key 🔑 waiting to be found.

Your task:
1. Explore the repository's history. 🗂️
2. Use your Git skills to uncover the hidden key. 🕵️‍♀️
3. Enter the key to complete the challenge! ✅

Tip: Think outside the box, and remember... not everything is what it seems. 😉

Good luck, and may the Git force be with you! ✨
